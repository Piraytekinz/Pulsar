# Pulsar
Pulsar is an AI model which generates audio from images, bridging the gap between static visuals and audio.

This demonstrates how a model can generate clean unstructured audio data without needing a discriminator. The goal is to reduce training time while ensuring accurate audio generations. Hence, I decided to build a model which converts images to audio without using a discriminator. 

From that change I made, training time was significantly reduced from hours to only a few minutes while maintaining accuracy.
